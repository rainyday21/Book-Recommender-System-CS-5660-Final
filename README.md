# CS 5660: Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence

Software Requirements: 
  - Our code is in a Jupyter Notebook file and can be run via Google Colab or locally using suitable hardware.


Steps to set up the environment: 
  - Hardware Requirements: On Google Colab, switch from CPU to the highest GPU since we’re tokenizing a large amount of data.
  - Once you have the correct hardware requirements, Run All on the Google Colab to begin seeing the visualizations and results. 
  - Optional: NVIDIA RAPIDS packages can be used for increased GPU acceleration for the dimensionality reduction as displayed in the packages section. For further information:

Command-line instructions or GUI Usage: 

- The system will prompt the user for their favorite book and favorite genre. Thus it will require two command-line inputs from the user and you should see 10 recommended books at most along with the evaluation metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, MAP, MRR
